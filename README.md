<h2 align="center">🚀 Full Stack Web Developer 🚀</h2>

Welcome to my github profile,

A couple of years ago I became interested in web development and started studying programming at UOC and at ISDI Coders Full Stack bootcamp, formerly Skylab. 

My background ranges from coordinating tv programs to scripting for youth series and books. I'm passionate about translating ideas into code and creating digital experiences, with a proactive approach and interpersonal skills.

I apologize for having most of my repositories on private viewing. Don't let that stop you from contacting me in case you want to know more or even collaborate together. <strong>Shall we talk about code?</strong>
